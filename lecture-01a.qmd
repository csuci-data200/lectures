## Introductions: you all

1. On the paper I hand out please write 

    - something about yourself (such as "I have two cats named Kiki and Thor"). 
*Do not write something visually apparent like I have long hair, and do not your name or your major*
    - how many students you know on campus

2. Pass your paper back to me

3. Once I pass you a random paper you have 5 minutes to find the person whose paper you have. Write their name and major on the paper.

4. Keep the paper I passed out to you because we will introduce each other using the information on the paper.

## What is Data Science?

> Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data. Wikipedia

## What is Data Science?


> Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession. Wikipedia

**What types of data will we use in this course** 

We will use a variety of datasets from biological studies to business answering questions serving different purposes in life. Data will come different size, shape, and form and will include numbers, categories, text etc.

##

**Is this a statistics course or a computing course?**

A little bit of both. 

. . .

**Do I need prior programming/statistics experience?**

Nope. No prior programming experience is expected.


## Lab

Let's kick off this class by doing some data science!

In CI Learn under this week's module there is a **lab-01a.qmd** file (this is the lab for week 1 lecture a). Please download it and open it in RStudio.
